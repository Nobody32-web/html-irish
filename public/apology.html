<p class="dancing-script">I’ve been meaning to reach out, and I want to sincerely apologize for not being able to be with you during this time. Please know that it’s not because I don’t want to—I truly do. 
    Unfortunately, my current financial situation has made it very difficult for me to travel or be physically present.
This wasn’t an easy decision, and it weighs heavily on me. I value our connection deeply, and it pains me that I can't show that in person right now. Life has thrown a few unexpected challenges my way, and I’m doing my best to work through them.
I hope you can understand that this is only temporary. I’m working hard to get back on my feet, and I genuinely look forward to the day I can make it up to you.
Thank you for your patience and understanding. Your presence in my life means more than words can express.
<h1>I love you so much BEB!</h1>
</p>

<h2> sincerely yours,</h2><br>
